#Problem statement : 
In these days, people got awareness to donate and they come front to donate whether it is organs or blood. Organ donation is a big-time charity work which is supported by Government programmes, social organizations, boot camps, Ngo's etc.
When one or more organs have failed or are about to fail, a patient is in really critical condition and has to be treated with the required organs. The needy patient and his relation will be in search of the required organs from hospital to hospital and contact each and every one. 
Unfortunately, we don’t have a centralized system for all donated organs which are available in hospital across the country. At this moment, a centralized database for all donated organs and its availability in all networked hospitals.
